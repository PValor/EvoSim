# EvoSim
## Goal
<p>The final goal of this application is to simulate natural selection in a natural water-based environment.
Creatures will be made of Joints and Arms and will contract of expand their members according to an internal timer for each joint.

The criteria for the "natural selection" will be a score based on the distance from the starting point, and the average energy spend per articulation.
The top 500 creatures will be selected each generation to be used as a baseline for the next.</p>
